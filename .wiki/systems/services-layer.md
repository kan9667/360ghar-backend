# Services layer

Active contributors: Saksham, Ravi

The services layer is where business logic lives. It is the largest layer in the codebase (50+ modules, including the largest file `app/services/user.py` at 951 lines) and the single home for rules shared by REST endpoints, MCP tools, and the AI agent. All services are async-first and inject `AsyncSession` via FastAPI dependencies, so database I/O never blocks the event loop.

The layer follows a service class pattern: each service takes an `AsyncSession` in its constructor and exposes async methods. Free functions are also common for stateless helpers (e.g. `get_user_by_phone`). Endpoints in `app/api/` are thin controllers that validate input, call a service method, and serialize the result.

## Key abstractions

| Abstraction | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Service class | `class CoreService: def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession)` | Holds the session, exposes async methods |
| Free function | `async def get_user_by_phone(db, phone)` | Stateless helper that takes the session explicitly |
| 3-tuple return | `(items, next_cursor, has_more)` | Cursor pagination for list/search/recommendations |
| Background session | `AsyncSessionLocalBG` | Used by schedulers and SSE for non-request work |
| AI provider factory | `app/services/ai.get_ai_provider` | Gemini/GLM provider selection with retries |
| Shared tool logic | `app/mcp/tool_ops/` | Business logic reused by MCP servers and the AI agent |

## How it works

```mermaid
graph TD
    Endpoint["app/api endpoint"] -->|AsyncSession via Depends| Service["Service class<br/>__init__(db: AsyncSession)"]
    Service --> Repo["app/repositories<br/>complex queries"]
    Service --> Models["app/models ORM"]
    Service --> AI["app/services/ai<br/>Gemini/GLM providers"]
    Service --> Cache["app/core/cache<br/>CacheManager + decorators"]
    Service --> SSE["app/core/sse<br/>emit after commit"]
    MCP["app/mcp tool"] --> ToolOps["app/mcp/tool_ops"]
    ToolOps --> Service
    AIAgent["app/services/ai_agent"] --> ToolBridge["tool_bridge"]
    ToolBridge --> ToolOps
```

Services own the unit of work: they begin queries on the injected session, commit on success, and roll back on error. Flatmates user-visible state changes queue Supabase Realtime broadcasts via `queue_flatmates_realtime_event`, which publishes only after commit. List endpoints follow the recent cursor pagination refactor (June 2026): property list, search, recommendations, users, agents, bookings, visits, and blog all return `(items, next_cursor, has_more)` tuples.

## Integration points

- **Endpoints** in `app/api/api_v1/endpoints/` instantiate services with `Depends(get_db)`.
- **MCP servers** call the same services through `app/mcp/tool_ops/`, never re-implementing business rules. See [features/mcp-servers](../features/mcp-servers.md).
- **AI agent** routes tool calls through `app/services/ai_agent/tool_bridge.py` into `tool_ops`.
- **Schedulles** in `app/services/*_scheduler.py` register jobs on the shared scheduler; see [infrastructure](infrastructure.md).
- **Cache** is applied via `@cached` decorators and `PropertyCacheManager`; see [cache-subsystem](cache-subsystem.md).

## Entry points for modification

- New business rule: add a method to the relevant service (or a new service module), then call it from the endpoint, MCP tool, and AI agent tool bridge via `tool_ops`.
- New list endpoint: return a 3-tuple `(items, next_cursor, has_more)` and use `keyset_filter` / `keyset_payload` from `app/schemas/pagination.py`.
- New background job: register it on the shared scheduler via a `start_*_scheduler` function called from `app/infrastructure/lifespan.py`.
