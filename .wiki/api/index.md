# API

360Ghar exposes a single REST surface at `/api/v1/*` plus two MCP servers at `/mcp` and `/mcp-admin`. This page maps the REST route groups. For the MCP surface, see [features/mcp-servers.md](../features/mcp-servers.md). For auth, see [authentication.md](authentication.md).

## Router composition

All REST routers are mounted by `app/api/api_v1/api.py` onto a single `APIRouter` named `api_router`, which the app factory mounts at `/api/v1`. The file imports 41 endpoint modules (plus `app/api/deeplinks.py` mounted via `deeplinks_api_router`) and calls `include_router` 43 times, with explicit `prefix` and `tags`. Tags drive the OpenAPI grouping in Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs`. The authoritative full OpenAPI spec is committed at `docs/openapi.json` (regenerate with `uv run python scripts/generate_openapi.py`); a curated flatmates-only subset lives at `docs/flatmates-openapi.yaml`.

## Health and docs

- `/health` - root-level health check (Railway healthcheck target)
- `/api/v1/health` - redirects to `/health`
- `/api/v1/docs` - Swagger UI
- `/api/v1/redoc` - ReDoc
- `/api/v1/openapi.yaml` - OpenAPI spec

## Conventions

- Endpoints are thin controllers. They validate input via Pydantic schemas, enforce auth through dependencies, and delegate to `app/services/`.
- List endpoints return 3-tuples `(items, next_cursor, has_more)` for keyset cursor pagination (June 2026 refactor).
- Streaming endpoints (SSE, AI agent chat) release the main DB session and use the background pool via `get_bg_db`.
- MCP routes (`/mcp`, `/mcp-admin`) are mounted outside `api_router` and bypass the request ID middleware for streaming tool calls.
