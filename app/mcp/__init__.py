    - admin_mcp: Admin MCP server for agents and administrators

URLs:
    - /mcp        -> user_mcp (primary endpoint for end-user applications)
    - /mcp-admin  -> admin_mcp (agent and admin tools)

Authentication:
    All servers use Supabase JWT authentication via OAuth 2.1 with PKCE.
    User roles are extracted from the token claims.
