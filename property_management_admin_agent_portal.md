# Property Management — Admin & Agent Portal UI/UX Specification

This document defines the **web portal UI/UX** needed to fully operate the **Property Management** system (Owners + Relationship Managers + Tenants) on top of the existing 360Ghar backend and the new PM API surface:
- PM APIs: `/api/v1/pm/*`
- Public applications: `/api/v1/pm/public/*`
- OTP Auth: `/api/v1/auth/otp/*`

It is aligned to the current backend direction:
- **Manual-first workflows** (rent ledger + receipt uploads, no payment gateway yet)
- **No vendor module** (work orders handled by Owner/RM)
- **No third‑party integrations** until later phase (payments, KYC verification, background checks, e-sign)
- RM assignment reuses existing **`users.agent_id`** (one RM per owner for MVP)
- KYC documents are stored as **documents linked via `documents.user_id`** (admin-driven)

---

## 1) Purpose and Audience

### 1.1 Portals covered
1) **Admin Portal (Back-office)**
- Used by operations/admin teams to manage users, agents, assignments, KYC docs, and supervise the full PM dataset.

2) **Agent Portal (Relationship Manager / RM)**
- Used by agents to manage properties, leases, rent, maintenance, documents, inspections, and reports **for assigned owners only**.

### 1.2 Primary UX goals
- **Fast operations**: data-dense tables, powerful filtering, bulk actions.
- **Low error rate**: guardrails, validation, and “undo where possible”.
- **Auditability**: clear “who did what” in activity + audit trails.
- **Owner-scoped work**: agents always work within an owner/portfolio context.

---

## 2) Roles, Permissions, and Access Model

### 2.1 Roles
**Admin**
- Full access to all portfolios and all PM entities.
- Can manage agent accounts and assign agents to owners.
- Can upload KYC documents and update KYC status (manual).
- Can run exports, generate reports, and perform operational overrides.

**Agent (Relationship Manager)**
- Access only to owners where `owner.user.agent_id == agent.agent_id`.
- Full operational authority within that owner scope for:
  - Applications, leases, rent charges/payments, expenses
  - Maintenance requests/work orders (no vendors)
  - Documents and inspections
  - Reports

**Support / Read-only (optional)**
- Read-only views of data, no financial or assignment operations.

### 2.2 Owner selection behavior (Agent portal)
The Agent portal must provide an **Owner Selector** in the top bar:
- Search owners by name/phone.
- Switching owners changes scope for all modules (portfolio, leases, rent, maintenance, documents, reports).
- Store last selected owner in local storage.

### 2.3 Tenant data access (privacy)
Even for admin/agent:
- Tenant documents should only be visible if linked to the owner’s portfolio and permitted by document sharing rules.
- Mask sensitive fields by default (ID numbers) where applicable; reveal only on explicit action (admin only).

---

## 3) Information Architecture (Navigation)

### 3.1 Layout and navigation style
Desktop-first web app with:
- **Left sidebar navigation**

8) **Expenses**
9) **Maintenance**
10) **Documents**
11) **Inspections**
12) **Reports**
13) **Notifications & Scheduler** (phase 2)
14) **Audit Log**
15) **Settings**

### 3.3 Agent portal sidebar (recommended)
1) **Dashboard**

3) **Managed Properties**
4) **Applications**
5) **Leases**
6) **Rent Ledger**

## 4) Global UX Patterns (Consistency Rules)

### 4.1 List pages (tables)
All list pages should share:
- Search input (debounced)
- Filter bar + “More filters” drawer
- Sort menu
- Pagination (server-driven) + page-size selector
- Sticky bulk-action bar when rows selected

### 4.2 Entity detail pages
Use a consistent structure:
- Header: entity title + status chip + key metadata + primary actions
- Tabs or sections:
  - Overview
  - Related items
  - Activity / audit trail
- Right-side action panel (optional) for quick edits

### 4.3 Status chips + timelines
Always display status in lists and details:
- Lease status, rent charge status, maintenance/work order status, application status, property management status.
Provide a compact timeline component for:
- Lease lifecycle
- Maintenance/work order updates
- Document versioning (phase 2)

### 4.4 File upload UX (documents, receipts, inspections)
Standard upload component:
- Drag & drop + browse
- File type validation (PDF/images/doc)
- Progress + retry
- Metadata capture (type, title, linked entity IDs)
- Preview + delete before submit

Configuration pages (MVP-lite):
- Document types and categories (display labels; backend enums are fixed)
- Late fee policy presets (fixed / percentage presets stored in frontend config or backend JSON store in phase 2)
- Application form templates (frontend templates; backend stores answers JSON)
- Notification preferences (phase 2)

---

## 6) Agent Portal (RM) — Modules & Screens

---

## 7) Key Operational Flows (Step-by-Step UX)

### 7.1 Admin: Onboard a new Owner into PM
1) Create/verify owner user (existing user module).
2) Assign RM (set `users.agent_id`).
3) Add managed properties (or mark existing properties as managed).
4) Upload KYC docs (documents with `user_id = owner.id`).
5) Set KYC status (MVP suggestion: store in user preferences JSON; display in UI).
6) Optional: create application form to start tenant onboarding.

### 7.2 Agent: Convert applicant → tenant lease
1) Receive submission in Applications Inbox.
2) Review answers + documents.
3) Approve and create lease (pre-fill tenant info).
4) Upload signed lease PDF (manual).
5) Generate rent charges for next N months.

### 7.3 Agent: Monthly rent operations
1) Open Rent Ledger → filter “Overdue / Due this week”.
2) Call tenant (outside system) and record payment when received.
3) Upload payment receipt/proof.
4) Ensure charge status updates to partial/paid.
5) Export monthly receipts for owner (CSV + doc links).

### 7.4 Agent: Maintenance lifecycle without vendors
1) Review incoming maintenance request.
2) Assign to self, set priority and schedule, estimate cost.
3) Update progress status (in progress → completed).
4) Upload invoice/completion photos.
5) Close request with final notes and actual cost.

---

## 8) Data & Form Design (Guardrails)

### 8.1 Late fee policy (JSON-backed)
Portal should provide a simple builder:
- Type: Fixed amount OR Percentage
- Amount/percent
- Grace period days
Preview: “If rent ₹25,000 is late by X days → late fee ₹Y”

### 8.2 Rent charge generation UX
Generate charges modal:
- Scope: owner (all active leases) OR specific lease
- Start month (default current)
- Months count (1–24)
Show result:
- Created count, skipped count (idempotency)

### 8.3 Tenant identity for lease creation (MVP)
Lease tenant options:
- Existing user (search by phone)
- New tenant without account (store name/phone/email in lease record)
Portal should show a warning when tenant has no account: “Tenant portal access will be unavailable until invited/created.”

---

## 9) Non‑Goals (Do not design as MVP dependencies)
- Payment gateway collection (UPI/card), autopay, retries
- Background check integration and scoring
- E-signature workflow provider integration
- Vendor onboarding, assignment, payouts
- Bank account sync and accounting integrations

These can be included as **Phase 3** “coming later” placeholders in UI, but must not block MVP.

---

## 10) Phase Roadmap (Portal Enhancements)

### Phase 2
- Notification scheduler UI: rent reminders, lease expiry reminders (with logs)
- Communication hub (owner/tenant/RM messaging) if backend adds messaging
- Recurring expenses management and materialization UI
- Strong audit log with diffs for finance/lease changes

### Phase 3 (Integrations)
- Payment gateway receipts + reconciliation UI
- KYC verification and background checks dashboards
- E-sign tracking pages and signature status timelines
- Accounting exports/integrations (QuickBooks/Xero)
