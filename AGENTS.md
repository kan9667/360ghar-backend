# 360Ghar Backend Operating Contract

> **Canonical guide: [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).** Read it first for stack, structure, commands, and conventions.

This repository uses repo-local docs as the source of truth for contributors and agents. The goal is to keep architecture, contribution rules, and test expectations explicit and lightly enforced.

## Operating Docs
- [Architecture Contract](docs/architecture-contract.md)
- [Contribution Contract](docs/contribution-contract.md)
- [Testing Contract](docs/testing-contract.md)
- [Terminology And Ownership](docs/terminology-and-ownership.md)
- [Machine Contract Inventory](docs/repo-contract.json)

## Build And Validation

**Default: run the server directly against the dev env — no Docker.** See CLAUDE.md › *Testing without Docker*.

```bash
uv run python run.py            # dev env (.env.dev → hosted Supabase), API on :3600
uv run pytest tests/ -v         # needs a local Postgres+PostGIS+pgvector at TEST_DATABASE_URL — NEVER the Supabase URL
```

`docker-compose up -d db redis` only provisions a throwaway Postgres+Redis for local `pytest` — it is not needed for server-run testing.

> **Note:** Dev dependencies (pytest, ruff, mypy) are in the `dev` optional group. Install with `uv sync --extra dev`.

## Database Migrations

Use `scripts/run_supabase_migrations.py` to apply SQL migrations against the remote Supabase database. Do **not** use `supabase db push` for remote databases — that command is for local development.

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_supabase_migrations.py              # apply all pending
uv run python scripts/run_supabase_migrations.py --dry-run    # preview only
uv run python scripts/run_supabase_migrations.py --file <filename>.sql  # single file
uv run python scripts/run_supabase_migrations.py --env .env.prod  # use a different env file
```

The script tracks applied versions in a `schema_migrations` table, making it idempotent.

## Database Safety Rules

- **Never delete real user data**: Destructive database operations (`DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DROP`) on tables that may contain real user data must be reviewed with the user before execution. Never run `02_clear_data.py` against production.
- **Seed data clearance is selective**: The `02_clear_data.py` script uses `WHERE is_seed_data = true` on `users`, `agents`, and `properties` tables, and deletes child records via subquery joins to seed parents. This ensures real (non-seed) data is never touched.
- **Child tables are protected via FK joins**: Tables without an `is_seed_data` column (PropertyImage, Visit, Booking, BlogPost, etc.) are deleted only when their parent seed record is identified via `WHERE fk_col IN (SELECT id FROM parent WHERE is_seed_data = true)`. Never issue bare `DELETE FROM <table>` on tables that could contain real data.
- **Before destructive operations**: Always confirm the target database is a development environment, not production. Use `--dry-run` flags where available to preview changes.
- **New seeded models**: When adding a new model that is populated by seed scripts, either add an `is_seed_data` boolean column (with `server_default=text("false")`) or ensure a FK cascade chain links it back to a parent with `is_seed_data`.

## Hosted Supabase Test Runs

- Use Supabase itself for integration/QA tests when local Postgres cannot reproduce hosted behavior, but only against a clearly identified development or staging Supabase project. Never point tests, seeders, cleanup scripts, or ad-hoc SQL at the production/live Supabase database unless the user explicitly asks and approves the exact operation.
- Before running tests against hosted Supabase, verify the active env file and database URL. Do not use `.env.prod` for test runs. Prefer a dedicated `TEST_DATABASE_URL` or non-production env file whose project name makes the target obvious.
- Test data written to Supabase must be scoped for cleanup: set `is_seed_data = true` where the model supports it, add a unique test marker such as `test_run_id`, slug/email/phone prefixes like `agent_test_`, or use dedicated test users. Do not update rows that lack a test marker or seed flag.
- Prefer transaction rollback for automated tests. If committed writes are needed to test real Supabase behavior, record the inserted IDs/markers and clean them up at the end of the run using exact `WHERE` predicates. Run a count/select preview before cleanup and never use bare `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, or `DROP`.
- After hosted Supabase testing, clean test data before reporting completion. If cleanup fails or cannot be verified, report the remaining marker/IDs and stop rather than attempting broad destructive cleanup.

## Layering Rules
- HTTP endpoints in `app/api/api_v1/endpoints/` validate input, enforce auth through dependencies, and delegate business logic to `app/services/`.
- REST route composition lives in `app/api/api_v1/api.py`; `app/factory.py` is the composition root, while app wiring, middleware, lifespan, and MCP mounts live in `app/infrastructure/`.
- Business rules belong in `app/services/`. Reuse service functions from REST, MCP, and AI-agent surfaces instead of re-implementing them.
- Persistence models live in `app/models/`; request and response shapes live in `app/schemas/`.
- Social and flatmates models (matches, conversations, blocks, reports) live in `app/models/social.py`; flatmates service logic lives in `app/services/flatmates/` package (conversations, helpers, interactions, matching, moderation, profiles, visits) with REST endpoints in `app/api/api_v1/endpoints/flatmates.py` and admin moderation endpoints in `app/api/api_v1/endpoints/flatmates_admin.py`.
- MCP servers and ChatGPT-specific tool wrappers live in `app/mcp/`. They may format tool responses, but authorization and state changes should still flow through shared services where possible.
- Shared MCP tool business logic lives in `app/mcp/tool_ops/`. These functions are called by both MCP servers (`user_server.py`, `app/mcp/admin/`) and the AI agent tool bridge (`tool_bridge.py`) — do not duplicate this logic.
- AI-agent orchestration lives in `app/services/ai_agent/`. Tool registration and model streaming belong there, but tool behavior should still call shared service-layer code.
- Notification dispatch flows through `app/services/notification_config.py` (type registry with channel, priority, frequency caps) → `app/services/notification_dispatcher.py` (multi-channel send) → `app/services/notifications/` (CRUD + Supabase push, sub-modules: crud, fcm, helpers, push) → `app/services/push_notification.py` (FCM). New notification types must be registered in the `NOTIFICATION_TYPES` dict.
- Flatmates app-wide real-time events flow through Supabase Realtime private Broadcast channels via `app/services/flatmates/realtime.py`. Service methods queue events on the SQLAlchemy session and publish only after commit. Clients subscribe to `flatmates:user:{local_user_id}` with Realtime Authorization policies on `realtime.messages`. Event types: `new_match`, `new_message`, `conversation_updated`, `visit_updated`, `listing_status_changed`, `new_notification`. New flatmates realtime event types or subscriptions must update CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.
- OAuth token/code persistence uses `app/services/oauth_token_store.py` backed by CacheManager. Token stores require a real (non-null) cache backend in production.
- `app/modules/` is reserved for future physical domain entrypoints. Do not recreate shim-only re-export packages; use the current concrete homes (`app/api`, `app/services`, `app/models`, `app/schemas`, `app/repositories`, `app/mcp`) until a domain is migrated.
- Cross-cutting infrastructure belongs in `app/infrastructure/`, `app/core/`, `app/middleware/`, and `app/vector/`.
- `app/infrastructure/` owns lifespan wiring (startup/shutdown orchestration), middleware registration, exception handlers, MCP HTTP app construction, and route mounting. `app/factory.py` is a thin composition root that delegates to `app/infrastructure/`.
- `app/infrastructure/scheduler.py` provides a shared `AsyncIOScheduler` singleton. All background cron jobs (blog, notifications, vector sync, data hub) register on this single instance via `get_scheduler()`. Do not create per-module `AsyncIOScheduler` instances.
- `app/core/http.py` provides shared `httpx.AsyncClient` singletons (`get_scraper_client()`, `get_blog_client()`, `get_general_client()`, `get_supabase_auth_http_client()`) for connection reuse. Do not create ephemeral `async with httpx.AsyncClient()` per request — use the shared clients with per-request `timeout=` overrides instead.
- `app/shared/` is reserved for future physical shared packages. Current shared contracts and helpers remain in `app/core`, `app/schemas`, `app/utils`, and endpoint dependencies.
- `app/config/` is a re-export package; `from app.config import settings` is the canonical import location (delegates to `app/core/config.py`).
- AI provider abstraction lives in `app/services/ai/` with a factory (`get_ai_provider`) supporting Gemini and GLM providers. All AI features (vastu, tour AI, blog generation) go through this layer with automatic retries and fallback.
- Blog SEO fields (meta_title, meta_description, focus_keyword, canonical_url, og_image_url, reading_time_minutes, word_count) are auto-computed from the post title/body when not explicitly provided, via helpers in `app/services/blog.py`.

## Contributor Requirements
- New REST endpoint modules must be routed through `app/api/api_v1/api.py`, covered by tests, and registered in `docs/repo-contract.json`.
- New service modules must follow existing naming conventions, keep I/O async when touching the database, and be registered in `docs/repo-contract.json`.
- New MCP tools, widget bindings, or AI-agent tool bridges must update the architecture and terminology docs when they add a new public surface or execution pattern.
- New background jobs or schedulers must be wired through `app/infrastructure/lifespan.py` startup, register their jobs on the shared scheduler from `app/infrastructure/scheduler.py`, and be documented in the architecture contract. Do not create new `AsyncIOScheduler` instances — use `get_scheduler()` to add jobs.
- Do not add new dependencies without checking current upstream documentation and compatibility with Python 3.12+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.x, and Pydantic v2.
- New outbound HTTP call sites must use the shared httpx clients from `app/core/http.py` (`get_scraper_client()`, `get_blog_client()`, `get_general_client()`, `get_supabase_auth_http_client()`) instead of creating ephemeral `async with httpx.AsyncClient()` per request. Use per-request `timeout=` overrides when the call needs a different timeout than the client default.

## Use Latest Versions & References
- **Always use the latest stable versions** of packages, SDKs, AI models, API versions, protocol versions, and any external references. Never rely on cached or training-knowledge version numbers, model names, API signatures, or SDK methods — these change frequently and are often outdated.
- **Research current docs before implementing**: Before using any 3rd party library, API, SDK, AI model, or protocol, look up the latest official documentation. Use web search, Context7 MCP tools, `WebFetch`, or `google_search` to retrieve up-to-date docs, version numbers, API references, and code examples.
- **Verify from official sources**: When referencing package versions, model names, API endpoints or signatures, SDK methods, protocol versions (e.g., MCP protocol version), or any external service, always confirm the latest from official sources (docs sites, GitHub releases, PyPI, npm, official changelogs). Never assume from memory.
- **Check changelogs and migration guides**: When upgrading any dependency or integrating a new service, review the official changelog/migration guide for breaking changes and new features.
- **Stay current with the ecosystem**: Periodically check for newer versions of key dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Supabase, FastMCP, etc.) and update when safe. Prefer latest official docs and examples over outdated tutorials or blog posts.

## Lint & Style Rules (enforced in CI)

All code must pass `uv run ruff check app/` before commit. The CI `lint` job enforces this — any violation fails the build.

**Imports (I001, UP035, F401, E402):**
- `from __future__ import annotations` must be the first import in every `.py` file (after docstrings).
- Use `list`/`dict`/`set`/`tuple`/`type` instead of `typing.List`/`Dict`/`Set`/`Tuple`/`Type`.
- Import `Callable`, `Awaitable`, `AsyncIterator`, `Sequence` from `collections.abc`, not `typing`.
- Remove all unused imports (F401). No "just in case" imports.
- All imports at file top before non-import code (E402). Use `# noqa: E402` only for unavoidable circular imports with an explanatory comment.

**Type annotations (UP045, UP006, UP007, UP037):**
- `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]`; `X | Y` instead of `Union[X, Y]`.
- `list[X]` instead of `List[X]`; `dict[K, V]` instead of `Dict[K, V]`.
- Remove unnecessary quotes in annotations (`"User"` → `User`).
- Forward references in models: add `from __future__ import annotations` + import under `TYPE_CHECKING`.

**Exception handling (B904):**
- `raise NewException(...) from None` when logging the original and raising a user-facing exception.
- `raise NewException(...) from e` when the original exception provides useful context.

**Equality (E712):** No `== True`/`== False`. Use the column directly or bitwise negation.

**Naming (E741):** Never use `l` as a variable name — use `lease`, `line`, `link`, etc.

**Unused variables (F841):** Don't assign to unused variables. Use `_` or `_name` to discard.

**Whitespace (W291, W292, W293):** No trailing whitespace, no whitespace on blank lines, files end with newline.

**Other:** `zip(a, b, strict=True)` (B905); set comprehensions not `set(gen)` (C401); no placeholder-free f-strings (F541); no name redefinitions (F811).
